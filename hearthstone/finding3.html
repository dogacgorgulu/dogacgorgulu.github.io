            <h2>Finding 3</h2>
            <p>Testing the classes was too obvious. In Hearthstone, some archetypes (strategies) dominate others, much like in rock-paper-scissors.
                However, according to HearthArena.com, one archetype dominates the others. Additionally, I believe I perform better with certain archetypes.

                In order to test my belief, I formulated the following null hypothesis:</p>
                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> The custom archetype does not significantly impacts win count.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The custom archetype significantly impact win count.</p>

            <h2>Custom Archetype</h2>

            <div class="image-caption">Win rate distribution by archetype.</div>

            <h3>Thresholds</h3>

            <p>Thresholds were set based on the correlations of the attributes.</p>
            The top 3 highest attributes were selected from the distance correlation: S = [Late-game, Early Removals, 5-Drops].
            For elements with at least low Pearson or Spearman correlation, the threshold was set to the Median. For others, the threshold was defined as the Median Â±3 (lower and upper bounds).

            <p>Null hypothesis was rejected (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.002).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the custom archetype significantly impact win count.</p>
