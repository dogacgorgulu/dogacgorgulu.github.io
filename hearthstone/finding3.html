            <h2>Finding 3</h2>
            <p>Even though commonly accepted archetypes exist,
                one might construct their own strategy.
                The aim of this section is to develop an off-meta solution: a custom archetype.</p>

                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> The custom archetype does not significantly impacts win count.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> The custom archetype significantly impact win count.</p>

            <img src="images/F3_3.png" alt="Graphic 1">
            <div class="image-caption">Distance correlation (W).</div>

            <h3>Thresholds</h3>

            <p>Thresholds were set based on the correlations of the attributes.</p>
            The top 3 highest attributes were selected from the distance correlation: S = [Late-game, Early Removals, 5-Drops].
            For elements with at least low Pearson or Spearman correlation, the threshold was set to the Median. For others, the threshold was defined as the Median ±3 (lower and upper bounds).

            <p>The null hypothesis was rejected (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.002).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the custom archetype significantly impacts the win count.</p>
