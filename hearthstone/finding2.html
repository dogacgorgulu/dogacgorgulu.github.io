            <h2>Finding 2</h2>
            <p>Testing the classes was too obvious. In Hearthstone, some archetypes (strategies) dominate others, much like in rock-paper-scissors.
                However, according to HearthArena.com, one archetype dominates the others. Additionally, I believe I perform better with certain archetypes.

                In order to test my belief, I formulated the following null hypothesis:</p>
                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> There is no significant difference in the mean win rates among the archetypes.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> There is a significant difference in the mean win rates among the archetypes.</p>

                <p>I decided to run an ANOVA test since I am examining whether there is a significant difference between the dependent groups in terms of their mean win rates.</p>

            <h2>Validating ANOVA</h2>
            <h3>Independence</h3>
            <p>The measurements should be independent, i.e., the measured value of one group should not be influenced by the measured value of another group.</p>
            <p>I assume independence based on the fact that this is a competitive game ðŸ¥´.</p>

            <h3>Homogeneity</h3>
            <p>The variances in each group should be approximately equal.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">Win rate distribution by archetype.</div>
            
            <h3>Homogeneity</h3>
            <p>I conducted Levene test.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Groups have equal variances.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Groups have different variances.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>According to the Levene test, I found that the assumption of homogeneity of variances was upheld (p = 0.362).</p>
            
            <h3>Normal distribution</h3>
            <p>The data within the groups should be normally distributed.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">Q-Q Plots with 95% Confidence Interval by Class</div>

            <p>In the Q-Q plot of Attrition (Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.007) and Mid-Range (Shapiro-Wilk p = 0.022), one data point violates the 95% confidence interval.
            The Shapiro-Wilk test indicates that I can assume normality for Mid-Range but not for Attrition. Therefore, I do NOT assume normality.</p>
            

        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Kruskal-Wallis</h2>
            <p>Since normality was violated and ANOVA is no longer valid, I conducted the Kruskal-Wallis test.</p>
            <img src="images/F2_2.png" alt="Graphic 2">
            <div class="image-caption">Win rate by archetype with means, per draft.</div>

            <p>According to the Kruskal-Wallis test, I failed to reject the null hypothesis (p = 0.502).</p>
            <p>In conclusion, there are no significant differences in win rates among the archetypes.</p>
