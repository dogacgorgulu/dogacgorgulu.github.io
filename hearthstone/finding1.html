            <p>In Hearthstone, many players believe they perform better with their favorite classes. I was one of them.  
                This makes sense because, besides being familiar with the cards, the class you pick directly affects the card pool and hero power.
                In order to test my belief, I formulated the following null hypothesis:</p>
                <p><br></p>

                <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> The mean win rate is equal across all classes.</p>
                <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> There is a significant difference in the mean win rates among the classes.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>I decided to run an ANOVA test since I am examining whether there is a significant difference between the dependent groups in terms of their mean win rates.</p>

            <p><strong>Validating ANOVA</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Assumption: Independence</strong></p>
            <p>The measurements should be independent, i.e. the measured value of one group should not be influenced by the measured value of another group.</p>

            <p><strong>Assumption: Homogeneity</strong></p>
            <p>The variances in each group should be approximately equal. This can be checked with the Levene test</p>

            <p><strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Groups have equal variances.</p>
            <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis:</strong> Groups have different variances.</p>

            <p><strong>Assumption: Normal distribution</strong></p>
            <p>The data within the groups should be normally distributed.</p>
